Objective: To create your personal portfolio.

To create a personal portfolio page, you need to be proficient in HTML5 and CSS3. In this
project, you will create a web page containing the standard information for a work portfolio,
including your name and image, projects, niche skills, and interests.

Exercise:
The portfolio page should have a header and footer section. The header section will include a
menu highlighting your personal information, contact information, and work. You can place your
photo at the top part of the page and include a short description of your professional career and
interests. Below this description, you can add a few work samples. The footer section can
contain your social media handles.
